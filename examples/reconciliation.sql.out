-- This file contains the sql queries plus their output, but we set the filetype to sql for better syntax highlighting

-- This is a fully working example script that shows reconcilation strategies.
--
-- Note that it uses `\gset` to store sql responses as variables. For example,
-- `\gset foo_` creates variables for each column in the response like
-- `foo_col1`, `foo_col2`, etc. These variables can then be used like
-- `:'foo1_col`.
-- The entire script can be passed to psql. If you are running postgres via the
-- pgledger docker compose, you can run this script with:
--
--   cat reconciliation.sql | \
--     docker compose exec --no-TTY postgres psql -U pgledger --echo-all --no-psqlrc
--
-- The goal of this script is to show some reconcilation examples. Reconcilation is the process
-- by which we check that our view of the world matches what we expect.
-- Let's start with a simple payment flow example, similar to the basic-example.sql script:
SELECT id FROM pgledger_create_account('user1.external', 'USD') \gset user1_external_
SELECT id FROM pgledger_create_account('user1.receivables', 'USD') \gset user1_receivables_
SELECT id FROM pgledger_create_account('user1.available', 'USD') \gset user1_available_
SELECT id FROM pgledger_create_account('user1.pending_outbound', 'USD') \gset user1_pending_outbound_
-- The first step in the flow is the user initiates a $50 payment, and we are
-- waiting for funds to arrive. The difference this time is we'll use some
-- metadata to help us track what's going on:
SELECT * FROM pgledger_create_transfer(
    :'user1_external_id',
    :'user1_receivables_id',
    50.00,
    metadata => '{"kind": "payment_created", "payment_id": "p_123"}'
);
               id                |         from_account_id         |          to_account_id          | amount |          created_at          |           event_at           |                      metadata
